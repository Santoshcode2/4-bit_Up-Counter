4-Bit Up Counter ‚Äì RTL to GDSII Flow
üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end VLSI design flow for a 4-bit up counter, starting from Verilog RTL coding to generating the final GDSII file. The flow covers functional verification, logical synthesis, physical design, and layout generation using industry-standard EDA tools.

The project was executed under the guidance of Dr. Hemanta Kumar Mondal.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methodology
1. RTL Design & Verification

Language Used: Verilog HDL

Steps:

Implemented Verilog RTL code for a 4-bit up counter.

Developed a testbench for functional verification.

Performed elaboration, compilation, and simulation.

Verified design correctness through waveform generation.

Tools Used:

Simulation & Verification: Cadence Xcelium (or ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, etc.)

2. Logical Synthesis

Tool Used: Cadence Genus

Steps:

Synthesized the RTL design into a gate-level netlist.

Applied timing, area, and power constraints.

Ensured design met functional equivalence post-synthesis.

3. Physical Design

Tool Used: Cadence Innovus

Steps:

Floorplanning ‚Äì Defined chip dimensions, I/O placement, and block arrangement.

Power Planning ‚Äì Implemented power rings, straps, and distribution network.

Placement ‚Äì Placed standard cells while optimizing for area and timing.

Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) ‚Äì Built a balanced clock distribution network.

Routing ‚Äì Connected all cells and I/O pins with optimized interconnects.

Timing Analysis ‚Äì Ensured timing closure across all paths.

4. Signoff & Layout

Steps:

Performed Design Rule Checks (DRC) and Layout vs Schematic (LVS) verification.

Generated the final GDSII file for tape-out.

Imported GDSII into Cadence Virtuoso to obtain the final layout view.
